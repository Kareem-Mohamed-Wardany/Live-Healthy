3. Take over-the-counter medications as directed by your doctor or pharmacist to manage your fever, cough, and other symptoms.

4. Follow your doctor's instructions carefully, and don't hesitate to seek medical attention if your symptoms worsen or if you experience any difficulty breathing.

Remember, it's essential to follow public health guidelines and recommendations to help prevent the spread of Covid-19 to others. Practice good hand hygiene, wear a mask when out in public, and practice social distancing to protect yourself and those around you.
